hello there! i'm u1terior, the polyglotal polymath who does the most insane mathematical stuff you've ever seen; zermelo & fraenkel et al fear me for what i have done to the set theory framework.

here's a list of random things that are pretty cool about me:
- i'm *very* good at civics
- i program in ~14 languages
  - html
  - css
  - js
  - ts
  - lua
  - java
  - sql
  - r
  - rust (limited)
  - arm64 (limited)
  - latex
  - c
  - swift
  - python
- i speak english natively, spanish fluently, decent french & german, and very minor italian
- i've made a [mathematical law](https://academics.u1t.dev/archived-interfinite-law) (this is no longer valid; i'm no longer supporting the law. i will be writing a hypothesis on this soon)
- i love my newtonian gravitational physics & astrophysics
- i've also made an unbreakable encryption that has keys in the mega*BYTES* of data; although most of it is just \*noise\*, it's still ***very*** powerful
